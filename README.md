# Rutgers-Forum-Web-Design-Project

# Introduction

This is a project that I have done during my time at Rutgers University as part of a web design course. I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The project that I have done is to design a Rutgers forum to discuss 
different classes and other aspects of Rutgers University. I have split the project into parts of the website such as the main page, the login page, the welcome page, and sign up page. Most of the colors chosen for the 
design of the website was red, black, and white which are the main colors of Rutgers.

# Welcome page

This is a welcome page for my forum that discusses what the forum is. It tells students that they can find information about Rutgers in the forum. The welcome page has the text in a block with the border being 
grey, the welcome background color being red and the text being whtie.

# Signup page 

The sign up page is the page that allows students to register for the forum. It has fields for the name, email, and password for the student. I have also included an option for the student to choose the year they
are in. The background color of the signup block is blad with red text. 

# Login page 

The login page is the part of the website in which students can login to access the discussions of the forum. I made the background of the login page red. The login page is a rectangular block with a white background
and red text color. The login page has the email address and password with red background color and grey text. 

# Forum main page

The main forum page lists all of the majors of the forum page as well as other discussions part of Rutgers University. Each of the blocks of the majors are grey in color with red text. There is also notifications 
that pop up on the forum page about who joined the forum and new discussions that are created.
